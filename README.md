# ABIDE PLSC Analysis

This repo contains the scripts used to run a partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). 

## Scripts
- `plsc.Rmd`: main PLSC analysis script
- `beta.ipynb`: extracts the correlation coefficients using the Yeo atlas
- `plsc-ppt.ipynb`: determines the number of participants that have phenotypic data

## Simulated Data
To test the PLSC analysis script, we geneterated simulated csv files (`simulated_covariate.csv`, `simulated_rsfc.csv`, `simulated_sociocult.csv`) using the ABCD dataset.
